iOS 7 &amp; 8  Icons: Natives and Basics
**.sketch file**

##Tips:

* All icons are vectorized and editable
* Sketch 3 or later is required for best results
* Non-commercial production: the suggested use for all vector graphics is for personal or internal purposes, to practice technique, and help form and shape ideas and concepts


*NOTE: if you are using an earlier version of Sketch, shapes may not render correctly*


##Enjoy!
